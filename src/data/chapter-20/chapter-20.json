            "In an isosceles trapezium, the non-parallel sides (oblique sides) are equal in length by definition.",
            "Answer: equal"

          "solution": [
            "A trapezium has at least one pair of parallel sides. If a quadrilateral has two pairs of equal opposite sides, it is a parallelogram. A parallelogram is a special case of a trapezium.",

          "solution": [
            "A parallelogram with one right angle is a rectangle. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, so if one is 90°, all angles must be 90°.",

            "A diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-consecutive vertices. A quadrilateral has 4 vertices, and it has exactly 2 diagonals.",

          "solution": [
            "A key property of a rhombus is that its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. This means they intersect at a 90° angle.",
            "Answer: 90°"

            "A rectangle is a parallelogram, and a fundamental property of parallelograms is that opposite sides are equal in length.",
            "Answer: equal"

          "solution": [
            "A rhombus is a parallelogram with four equal sides. The option 'parallel' likely refers to a parallelogram. A square is a special type of rhombus, but every rhombus is a special type of parallelogram.",
            "Answer: parallelogram"

            "A property of all parallelograms is that their diagonals bisect each other, meaning they intersect at their midpoints.",
